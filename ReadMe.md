## Curve Name Replacer

The `curveClipBoardCopyPaster.py` script reads an input file (inCurves.txt) containing animation curve data and replaces occurrences of a specified string with another. The user provides the target string and replacement string as command-line arguments. Run the script as follows:

```bash
python replace_curves.py oldString newString
```
